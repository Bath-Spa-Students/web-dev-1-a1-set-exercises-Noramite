                Kimi no Na wa is by far a very enjoyable film from begining to end.

Fun watch for both people that have never seen anime and anime lovers that enjoy nice art and two nice main characters.
<br><br>
The flaws, are pretty glaring at first in the way that the story is sort of pushed back and forth that it's hard to make sense where in time is the story currently.
<br><br>
That's about it. The art, top quality as usual. The music, atmospheric. The characters, some complain they're "too dull," but the only characters that actually matter here are the main boy and girl lol which are both lovable.
<br><br>
The story, it has a beginning, middle, and end with a clear setting place and a mysterious way of wanting to know what exactly is going on and how it affects the actors. Plus, a lot of small details I bet many didn't catch on the first time.
<br><br>
The movie as a whole is a very spiritual mix of playing between reality and ethereal themes. A fun watch for the colors and the calm traditions of nature.
<br><br>
After much thought, I can say this movie is not as well detailed as 5 centimeters, but it does have a better consistency in plot direction and resolution that make it up. Which in overall, makes for a fun and engaging stable story.
<br><br>
People can be nitpick all they want, but at least this movie had a better production than most others that barely had any emotion.

As a viewer enthralled by captivating storytelling, I found myself swept away by the beauty and emotion of this anime movie.
                <br><br>
From its breathtaking animation to its heartfelt narrative, the movie is a testament to the power of visual storytelling. The animation is nothing short of stunning, with each frame meticulously crafted to perfection.

The story unfolds with a sense of wonder and mystery, as they embark on a journey to unravel the secrets of their connection and the forces that bind them together.

From laughter to tears, from joy to heartache, the movie takes viewers on an emotional rollercoaster that lingers long after the credits roll. The characters are beautifully written and relatable, making their struggles and triumphs feel all the more poignant.
<br><br>
Reflecting on my experience with the movie, I am inclined to give it a score of 9/10. While it may not be without its minor flaws, such as pacing issues in certain scenes, its strengths far outweigh any shortcomings. The movie's ability to transport viewers to another world and touch their hearts with its universal themes of love, loss, and longing is truly remarkable.
<br><br>

                A beautiful romantical masterpiece.
The story is very well written, it can be confusing when you watch it for the first time and dont keep your attention to the film. But if you follow it you will see one of the best storylines in my opinion
The animation are one of the best i´ve seen.
The characters are so nicely written. You basically have 2 students, one girl and one boy. The girl is a well known person due to her dad and family, on the other hand the boy is your typical student.
And lets speak about the Soundtrack for a bit. The Score in this Anime/Film is absolutley amazing. It captures every moment perfectly. In one scene you have happy and uplifting music and in the other one you just need to start crying.
I can only recommend it to everyone who wants a good romance.
